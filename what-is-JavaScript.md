# What is the JavaScript ?

**JavaScript** is a **scripting** or **programming language** that runs on the **client-side** and, more recently, on the **server-side**.  
- It makes web pages **interactive** and allows content to be **updated dynamically** by writing specific code that executes the desired action.  
- It can **manipulate HTML and CSS elements**, allowing us to **add or remove inputs**, **attach actions to buttons**, and perform various tasks.  
- Additionally, it enables us to **control user input data** by defining and enforcing expected values.
- **Fetching Data:** Communicate with servers via **APIs (AJAX, Fetch, WebSockets)**.
