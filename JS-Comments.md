#### Single Line Comments

Single line comments start with `//`.

Any text between `//` and the end of the line will be ignored by JavaScript (will not be executed).

This example uses a single-line comment.
```
let x = 5;   // I will be executed
// x = 6;   I will NOT be executed

```

#### Multi-line Comments

Multi-line comments start with `/*` and end with `*/`.

Any text between `/*` and `*/` will be ignored by JavaScript.

This example uses a multi-line comment (a comment block) to explain the code:

```
/*  
This is Comment and u can adding multiples line here
*/
```
**We need to know this to prevent execution of code when we are testing vulnerabilities later**
